# Platformer_PoC
Making our first steps in video game making, trying to make a good platformer. The end game is not yet designed.

## Build

### Microsoft Windows

The standard way is to use the CMAKE files contained within the project, and make a Visual Studio Solution out of it.

The (official documentation)[https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-170] details the steps to be followed in order to achieve this.

It is also possible to proceed by using (CMAKE-GUI)[https://cmake.org/download/] to select the CMAKE files and generate a VS solution

### Linux

The project can be compiled using the classic make command at the root folder. You need to use gcc.
